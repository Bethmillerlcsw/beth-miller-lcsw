                            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                            <p>
                                I spent years after college deciding what I felt the most committed to for a career, 
                                but was unable to land on one quickly. Finding the balance of passion and self care was quite difficult for me. 
                                I spent time in my career with homeless children and teenagers, engaged couples, children in foster care, 
                                foreign exchange students in America, parents, and students at school. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I ultimately found my passion for working with parents and also children to find who they truly are, 
                                what their needs are, and how to find a successful path for themselves. 
                                I thoroughly enjoy working with individuals and being able to find space to dive into the difficult things. 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-sm-8 col-md-5 col-lg-3 mx-auto">

                <h2>My Approach</h2>
                <p>
                    The main goals of spending time in a therapeutic space with me is supporting positive change in emotional regulation, 
                    trauma responses, daily life, and relationships for the client. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been through many trainings, but what I have learned from real life therapy is that everyone is an individual with specific desires, 
                    baggage, dislikes, and goals. Each client gets access to be their own guide with my support in a safe space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe in empowering emotional development with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. 
                    This type of work allows for clients to dive into their own thoughts, reactions, and how they would like any of these things to change. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, the idea that everyone is in charge of themselves and has their own level of desire for change is one of the main aspects of Motivational Interviewing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes for children, this means allowing the space for them to learn what is going on inside of them 
                    and give them time to process this through Child Centered Play Therapy, Art Therapy, or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. 
                </p>
