                            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                            <p>
                                My name is Beth Miller, and I am licensed as a Clinical Social Worker in North Carolina. 
                                I support individuals, couples, and families to navigate through difficult times in a safe, therapeutic space. 
                                I've been providing therapy for over 5 years in the Asheville area, but it wasn't always this way. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have had many different roles over the past 12 years. I worked with homeless teenagers, foster children and parents, 
                                foreign exchange students, and have also provided in-home therapy and in-school services for high needs children and families. 
                                Ultimately, I was able to find the best balance of my own passions and self care while working in private practice. 
                                Here I provide a safe spaces for individuals, families, and couples where they can discover who they truly are, 
                                what their needs are, and how to find the most successful path for themselves.
                            </p>

                <h2>My Approach</h2>
                <p>
                    The main goals of spending time in a therapeutic space with me is supporting positive change in emotional regulation, 
                    trauma responses, daily life, and relationships. I have been through many trainings, 
                    but what I have learned from real life therapy is that everyone is an individual with specific desires, baggage, dislikes, and goals. 
                    Each client gets access to be their own guide with my support in this safe space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe in empowering emotional development and cognitive awareness with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Problem Solving Therapy. 
                    This type of work allows for clients to dive into their own thoughts, reactions, and how they would like any of these things to change. 
                    Also, the idea that everyone is in charge of themselves and has their own level of desire for change is one of the main aspects of Motivational Interviewing 
                    and is highly supported in Art Therapy techniques as well. I have enjoyed recently learning more about Emotionally Focused Therapy, and will be EMDR trained shortly as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes for children, giving a therapeutic space means allowing them to learn what is going on inside of them 
                    and give them time to process through Child Centered Play Therapy, Art Therapy, or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please reach out today if you would like to see if it would be a good fit to work together.
