                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
                <h2>Are you able to accept new clients?</h2>
                <p>
                    Yes, I am currently accepting new clients. We can speak during a phone consultation to check in about scheduling and see if we are a good fit.
                </p>
                <h2>Do you have any appointments on evenings or the weekend available?</h2>
                <p>
                    I have limited availability for evening and weekend sessions. Please reach out and I can do my best to accommodate your schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>What does therapy look like?</h2>
                <p>
                    The first step to starting therapy is to have a phone consultation to discuss reasons for seeking support and to decide if we are a good fit. After that, you will complete new client paperwork from the website. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then will have a scheduled intake appointment for 60-90 minutes where we go over what you're wanting from therapy, your background, and so on. If you are utilizing insurance, a mental health diagnosis will likely be discussed during this intake appointment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the initial intake session, sessions generally last around 45-55 minutes where I support you with your goals, ask questions to gain some insight, and give research proven techniques to support your needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have the expectation that my clients will come to session with topics and situations to discuss and share insight about their week. We can talk about emotions, thoughts, practice scenarios, make plans, and engage in activities to support more positive relationships, more understanding of self, and better control of emotions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sessions generally occur every week, but can be changed to accommodate needs and scheduling.
                </p>
                <h2>What is telehealth therapy?</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to meet client's needs, I see client both in person and on a telehealth platform. There are benefits of telehealth such as convenience, less wait times or commutes, less barriers for attendance, and studies have shown that it is just as effective as in person therapy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Telehealth is therapy provided through a HIPAA compliant video platform. That just means that it is more secure than Skype or Facebook video chat. A client can access this platform from their smartphone, tablet, or computer as long as there is internet connection or data available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I ask clients to find an appropriate place where they are comfortable to speak freely, often not being able to be overheard. Different people utilize different places such as an office, car, or room in their home. A public place generally will not allow someone to speak as freely and honestly as needed for therapy.
                </p>
                <h2>How long will I need to be in therapy?</h2>
                <p>
                    Generally speaking, there are clients who come to therapy for a short term support and those who come to therapy for a longer term support. Oftentimes clients do not know what they are looking for when they begin therapy. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clients use this space for support, finding clarity about situations, learning about themselves, identifying their symptoms, and deciding how to proceed daily. Some are tackling major traumatic events and using specific modalities like EMDR processing. I support clients in the length of treatment that works best for them, whether that is shorter term (6-12 months) or longer term (12+months). At times, internal and external happenings help decide how long therapy is supporting the client.
                </p>
                <h2>Do you assign homework?</h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the best techniques are, in fact, utilized outside of the therapy sessions. I often ask people to view exercises as experiments and notice behaviors, changes, reactions, and goals in their week. Meeting together will support change, but often the most progress is made by those who are willing to take techniques into their everyday life.
                </p>
                <h2>If I have had a negative experience with therapy, should I try again?</h2>
                <p>
                    Not every therapist is a good fit for every client. The right fit is important in making progress and gaining the support and safe space needed to succeed in therapy. Phone consultations can make it easier to figure out if I would be a good fit for you or if there would be another therapist that would be a better fit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a good thing to have gained insight from previous experiences and this can be helpful for a therapist to know as well. If we are working together and it doesn't feel like the right fit, I support your desire to discuss changes or what may work better for you during sessions. If the right fit doesn't happen with me, I do want you to find the right fitting therapist. I have a network of therapists, and could refer to one that has availability if that is helpful.
                </p>
                <h2>What about medication?</h2>
                <p>
                    I do not have the ability to prescribe medication. If you are currently on prescribed medication that benefits you, I support that. In my experience, medication can be a needed addition at times and not the right fit other times. I will support you in whatever decision you make regarding medication.
                </p>
                <h2>How is payment accepted?</h2>
                <p>
                    Payment is accepted through Blue Cross Blue Shield, United, Aetna, Cigna, Oscar, Caresource, and Amerihealth insurance (if there is a mental health diagnosis previously given or diagnosed at the intake appointment). I also offer self pay agreements with cash or major credit cards. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I can provide a Superbill for your insurance company and, at times, insurance companies may reimburse some therapy fees.
                </p>
